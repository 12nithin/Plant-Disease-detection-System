# Plant-Disease-detection-System
# Project Overview
The primary goal of the project is to develop a deep learning-based system for the identification 
and classification of plants. This system will analyse plant images to accurately determine the 
species and characteristics of the plants, facilitating applications in agriculture, botany, and 
environmental conservation. With advancements in deep learning, particularly Convolutional 
Neural Networks (CNNs), image-based plant classification has become highly feasible and 
reliable.
The project involves several key phases:
• Data Collection and Preprocessing
A comprehensive dataset of plant images will be collected, containing diverse species and plant 
characteristics. Images may include variations in lighting, orientation, and scale, which will be 
addressed through preprocessing steps such as resizing, normalization, and augmentation to 
ensure robust model performance.
• Model Development
We will employ deep learning models, with CNNs as the backbone for feature extraction and 
classification. The architecture will be designed to capture visual patterns like leaf shape, 
colour, and texture, which are crucial for distinguishing between plant species. Transfer 
learning may be used to leverage pretrained models, improving accuracy and reducing the 
training time.

• Training and Evaluation
The deep learning model will be trained using the processed plant image dataset. Various 
evaluation metrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1score, will be employed to assess 
the model's performance. Techniques such as cross validation will ensure that the model 
generalizes well across unseen data.
• Deployment and Application
Once the model achieves satisfactory performance, it will be deployed as a user-friendly 
application. This system can be utilized by farmers, botanists, and researchers for real-time 
plant identification, aiding in the diagnosis of plant diseases and the management of 
agricultural resources. The system will provide detailed insights into plant species, helping with 
crop monitoring and biodiversity assessments.
The project demonstrates the potential of deep learning to automate and enhance plant 
classification, paving the way for more efficient and scalable agricultural solutions. The 
resulting system will reduce the need for manual identification and serve as a valuable tool in 
managing plant species and their health.
